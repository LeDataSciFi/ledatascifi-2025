# Trading on stock return predictions

The [Lehigh Machine Learning Stock Prediction](https://lehighmlstockprediction.streamlit.app/) application was built to explain how practitioners 
create models to predict stock returns,
turn those predictions into a tradable portfolio, 
and assess its performance. 

The app
- Uses well-known predictive features from academic finance research downloaded from Open Asset Pricing 
- Builds stock prediction models using estimators from the simple (OLS) to the advanced (Neural Nets)
- Evaluates how profitable trading on these strategies are
- Contains a practical explanation of the methods, the data used, and how it's done 
- Compares different models to see which makes a portfolio that generates the highest returns
- Digs into the details of each model to assess risk-adjusted returns and more
